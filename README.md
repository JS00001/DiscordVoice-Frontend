# Discord Voice (Frontend)

This tool was created to mess with your friends in a discord voice call. You have the option to permanently server mute them, permanently server deafen them, or permanently disconnect them so that they cannot rejoin. This is for entertainment only.

This project uses **NextJS**

# Setup
- Download the files above. 
- Run `npm i`
- Navigate to `pages/index.js` and edit the `const url = "https://example.com"` to your backend domain.
- Ensure that the backend is online as well (You can find that here)
